# Full Stack Development Learning Repository

Welcome to the Full Stack Development Learning Repository! This repository serves as a record of my journey in learning full stack development. I'll be periodically updating this repository with various projects and resources related to full stack development. The primary purpose of this repository is to track my progress and showcase my growth in the field.


## Introduction

As an aspiring full stack developer, I am dedicated to honing my skills and gaining hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development. This repository will house a collection of projects, starting with HTML5 projects and expanding to more complex projects using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

## Projects

Currently, the repository contains projects focusing on HTML5. These projects showcase my understanding of web development fundamentals, including HTML structure, styling, and basic interactivity.

Stay tuned for future updates, as I'll be adding more projects utilizing the MERN stack. Each project will be a testament to my progress and learning in full stack development.

## Setup Instructions

To explore and run the projects in this repository, you will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports web technologies. Some recommended IDEs include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. Make sure you have the necessary tools and extensions installed to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the projects in this repository to gain insights into my learning journey. You can review the source code, experiment with it, and even provide feedback if you find something interesting or have suggestions for improvement.

## Future Plans

In the coming months, I plan to expand this repository by adding projects built using the MERN stack. This will demonstrate my ability to create dynamic and interactive web applications, showcasing proficiency in both front-end and back-end technologies.

Thank you for joining me on this learning journey. Your feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

# Web Development Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Web Development Learning** repository! This repository serves as a way for me to track my progress as I delve into the world of web development. As part of my learning journey, I'll be creating various projects using HTML5, CSS3, and eventually expanding into the MERN stack.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document and showcase my growth in the field of web development. By creating projects and keeping them here, I aim to not only track my progress but also share my journey with others who might find it useful or inspiring.

## Projects

Currently, this repository includes projects built with HTML5 and CSS3. These projects are simple and designed to help me grasp the fundamentals of web development. I plan to expand the repository over time by adding more projects that explore advanced concepts and technologies, including the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

## Getting Started

To run the projects in this repository, you'll need an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports web technologies. Here's how you can get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/itsminal/Web-Development.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred web development IDE.

3. Navigate to the project folder of the specific project you want to explore.

4. Open the HTML files in your browser to see the project in action.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning space, I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions from the community. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you come across any improvements or ideas that could enhance the projects or the learning experience.

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn and grow in my web development journey, I plan to add more projects using the MERN stack. These projects will involve creating interactive web applications, integrating databases, and exploring full-stack development.

Thank you for joining me on this learning adventure! Let's build amazing things together.

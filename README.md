# Web Development Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Web Development Learning Repository**! This repository serves as a record of my journey in learning web development. Here, you'll find a collection of projects, notes, and resources that document my progress in the world of web development.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to track and showcase my learning progress in the field of web development. As I delve into different technologies, frameworks, and concepts, I'll be updating this repository with new projects and insights gained along the way.

## Contents

At present, the repository features projects developed using HTML5. These projects are designed to showcase foundational web development skills. Additionally, I plan to expand the scope of this repository by adding more projects developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, providing a well-rounded understanding of full-stack web development.

## Getting Started

To run and explore the projects in this repository, you'll need an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports web technologies. Here are the general steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/itsminal/Web-Development.git
   ```

2. Open the project of your choice in your preferred IDE.

3. Launch the project's main HTML file in a web browser to view the project in action.

## Future Plans

As I continue my learning journey, I plan to expand this repository by adding projects developed using the MERN stack. These projects will provide insights into building dynamic and interactive web applications. Stay tuned for more updates!

## Feedback and Contact

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or questions you might have about the projects or my learning process. Feel free to reach out to me through the "Issues" section of this repository or by email at minalsaindane01@gmail.com.

Thank you for joining me on this web development learning adventure!

Happy coding!
